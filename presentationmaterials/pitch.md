# Seizure Sensor: 5-Minute Presentation Pitch Outline
## Introduction (1 minute)

Imagine waking up every morning, not knowing if your loved one made it through the night. For millions affected by epilepsy, including my own brother, this is our daily reality. Epilepsy, a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, affects 5 million new people each year. Nearly 80% live in low to middle-income countries, where access to care is limited.
These seizures can strike at any time, even during sleep, potentially proving fatal without immediate attention. I've witnessed my parents' sleepless nights, their worry tangible as they've tried everything from camera systems to motion-tracking watches to keep my brother safe.
But what if we could change this? What if we could create a guardian that never sleeps, a vigilant protector that watches over your loved ones when you can't? Ladies and gentlemen, we present to you Seizure Sensor – the future of epilepsy monitoring, designed to bring peace of mind to millions of families like mine around the world.
