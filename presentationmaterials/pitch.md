# Seizure Sensor: 5-Minute Presentation Pitch Outline

## Hook (30 seconds):
"Imagine waking up every morning, not knowing if your loved one made it through the night. For millions of families affected by epilepsy, this is their daily reality. But what if we could change that? What if we could create a guardian that never sleeps, a vigilant protector that watches over your loved ones when you can't? Ladies and gentlemen, We present to you Seizure Sensor – the future of epilepsy monitoring."

## Outline:

1. The Problem (45 seconds)
   - Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain that is characterized by a reoccurrence of seizures. According to the World Health Organization, 5 million people are diagnosed with epilepsy each year, and nearly 80% of that population live in low to middle income countries. It is known these seizures can occur at night, which can be fatal as most people sleep in a room alone, with no one to come and give immediate attention.
